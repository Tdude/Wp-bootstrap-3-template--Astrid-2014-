Wp-bootstrap-3-template
=====================================

Based on Bootstrap 3

A work in progress for someone who wants to present their site mostly with images rather than lengthy texts.

This is a WP-template with just a playful plethora of images in 4 different sizes everywhere on the site. Most of them are from a custom post type called "wpboot_tyger" and are grouped hierarchically. You have to set up your own categories in wpboot_tyger and do other stuff that I've hardcoded. This wasn't meant to be out on the webs from start, but go ahead, tweak/fork it if you like it and send me a link!

The functions are from all over the intarwebs under "share alike" licenses, and I've tried to maintain URLs to the authors.

I've used something like a BS3 Carousel template. The carousel images have a custom post type called ehhm...Bildspel (Img gallery in Swedish).



Best regards and good luck,
Tibor Berki
